                Hi, My name is Ricky. I was born in Nashville and raised there as well. My hobbies
                include line dancing, rock climbing, and reading with what little time I have in the night.
                I havn't done much travling ,however the most memorable trip I have is the trip I had in Hawaii.
                I have a 6 month old pit bull the loves to tear anything that he can get his hands on. I have always
                love a good problem to solve exspecially when it requires critical thinking. I am looking forward to
                the forward to the growth and opritunities web development will bring me in the future.  
            </p>
